# AdventOfCode2018

[copied from original website]
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

A repo for the puzzle solutions from the website below [or at least the ones I have solved; 
I will try to keep up but we shall see, the tasks' difficulty increases exponentially]

* Written in Java 12
** All test inputs are included in the solution itself as well as a method that fakes that input's insertion
